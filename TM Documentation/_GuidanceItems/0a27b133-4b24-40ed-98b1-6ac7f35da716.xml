    <Data><![CDATA[#### Start by configuring TEAM Mentor 4.0. 


The simple configuration file is located in
```TM40\TM\config\SiteData\TM```


~~~
{
  "tm_design":
    {
      "jade_Compilation_Enabled": true,
      "folder_Docs_Json"        : "../../data/Lib_Docs-json",
      "folder_Jade_Files"       : "../../code/TM_Jade",
      "webServices"             : "https://www36.teammentor.net/Aspx_Pages/TM_WebServices.asmx",
      "port"                    : 10001
    },
  "tm_graph":
    {
      "folder_Lib_UNO_Json"     : "../../data/Lib_UNO-json",
      "port"                    : 10002
    }
}
~~~


- Open the ```tm.config``` file
Here you only need to edit the line that says ```webServices ``` 
- Change the URL to the TM36 URL you configured in the settup of TM36 Backend section. 
- Change the port for both tm_design and tm_graph to something meaningful. You will need this later.

#### Set up components as services

* Open the Git Bash as Administrator
* Navigate to your ```TM40\TM\``` directory 
* Issue ```$ ./bin/winInstallSrvc.sh``` and follow the prompts
* Start the services for the first time using ```./bin/winTM.sh start```

The services will autostart at reboot.
