    <Data><![CDATA[Currently, the article editor has multiple limitations, among them:&nbsp;
<div>&#43; It doesn't handle copy and paste from Office documents well</div>
<div>&#43; The HTML code produced by the WYSIWYG editor is messy</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Some idea to improve this situation are:</div>
<div>&#43; Add multiple editor packages in parallel</div>
<div>&#43; Let the users choose/enable/disable editors based on personal preferences</div>
<div>&#43; Add an html editor for power users</div>
<div>&#43; Add a JavaScript based converter to convert from plain-text to HTML based on TEAM Mentor-specific style guide and format</div>
<div>&#43; Provide access to editors without having to create an article first, similar to opening notepad, jotting down some notes, then saving only if it's worth-while. The saved text should be saved as a draft that's not published to the public site, but should
 be either visible to the user alone or shared with others. Making the draft a published article should be also an option.</div>
