    <Data><![CDATA[TeamMentor uses [[http://git-scm.com/ | Git]] and [[https://github.com | GitHub]] as its Source-Code Version system/solution.

The latest version of TeamMentor is available on the public GitHub repositories of TeamMentor. There are a number of private repositories (forked from the public ones) that are used for the main TeamMentor customer release and its multiple customizations.

===Test/Eval version===
If you are looking to test or evaluate team mentor and just want to get your hands on its code, then grab a clone/fork of one of these repositories:

* [[https://github.com/TeamMentor-Owasp/Master]] - Latest stable release with OWASP Library
* [[https://github.com/TeamMentor/TeamMentor-Documentation]] - Latest stable release with TeamMentor's documentation library (i.e. this website)

===Development version===
If you want the latest development version this is the one to clone:

* [[https://github.com/DinisCruz/TeamMentor-3.0-Release]]

===Master version===
If you want to fork TeamMentor and manage your own libraries, the best one to use is the Master version:
* [[https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master]]
Note that it is this version that the other TeamMentor Forks use. New versions will always be pushed here, and then pulled into the other repositories (like the TeamMentor+SI_Library , TeamMentor+OWASP or TeamMentor+Documentation)

==Bug tracking==
The current list of Bugs/Issues is at  [[https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master/issues]] (note that there is a large number of issues still need to be moved from the legacy repository: [[https://github.com/DinisCruz/TeamMentor-v3.0/issues]])]]></Data>
