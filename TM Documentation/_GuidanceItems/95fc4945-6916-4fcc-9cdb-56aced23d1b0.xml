**What if we don’t have guidance for a particular finding? **

Some Fortify findings do not have associated TEAM Mentor guidance.  In this case you will not see “Custom Explanation” and “Custom Recommendation” provided by TEAM Mentor. You will see regular Fortify provided guidance.

**Reports in PDF**

Because our Custom Guidance uses hyperlinks, and HP Fortify PDF rendering engine does not interpret hyperlinks in custom content very well. You may see raw HTML characters when you generate a PDF report.
