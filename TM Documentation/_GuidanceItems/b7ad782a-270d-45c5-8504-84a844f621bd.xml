===Introduction===

In an ASP.NET website hosted in IIS with a valid SSL Certificate, the requirement is direct HTTP traffic to its HTTPS equivalent

===Solution: Using Global.asax in IIS 7.0===

A fast way to implement this is to made set all redirects in web.config to go through managed modules:

{{{
<system.webServer>
....
	<modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true">
	....
	</modules>
</system.webServer>

}}}

and to add the redirect capture on the global.asax.cs **Application_BeginRequest** method:

{{{
       protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {		
		if (!Request.IsLocal && !Request.IsSecureConnection)
		{
		    string redirectUrl = Request.Url.ToString().Replace("http:", "https:");
		    Response.Redirect(redirectUrl);
		}
        }
}}}

===Solution: Use Javascript redirect===
Another solution is to detect the use of http in JavaScript and do the redirection there. This solution has the side effect of needing to be executed on all the locations where a redirection is needed (which in some cases could actually be a feature)

{{{
	if(top.location.protocol=="http:"){
		if (location.replace){ 
	 		top.location.replace("https:"+top.location.href.substr(5));
		} else {
			top.location="https:"+top.location.href.substr(5);
		}
	}
}}}
