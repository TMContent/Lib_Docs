				slot_1_text 	 = "For organizations using static analysis tools, the results can often be overwhelming in terms of prioritization and remediation. As Security and Development teams progress in collaborating to ensure that software is delivered securely, they've needed a just-in-time 'pull' model, where people can look up the information they need right when they need it. In turn it becomes more effective to run results against prescriptive guidance in a central location so you can start to reduce software vulnerabilities."
				slot_1_company = "--Wendy Nather, Research Director, Enterprise Security Practice, 451 Research"
				slot_2_text 	 = "As attacks have shifted to the application layer in the enterprise, the demand has grown for an intelligent, integrated approach to managing security. Application security encompasses vulnerability detection and vulnerability remediation. Application security professionals should be trained in vulnerabilities detection technologies and processes, while application developers should be trained in interpreting application security testing results, and in techniques of fixing detected vulnerabilities."
